Earning the **Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS)** was the next big goal on my Kubernetes journey after clearing [**CKA**](https://bookofdaniel.in/posts/how-my-15-month-old-baby-helped-me-pass-the-cka-exam/) and [**CKAD**](https://bookofdaniel.in/posts/passing-ckad-after-your-cka/) back in October. Riding high on the success of those certifications, I felt confident and scheduled the CKS for November. Little did I realize that this exam would challenge not just my Kubernetes skills but also my consistency and mindset.

### **The Lazy Start**  

Initially, my preparation was half-hearted. I had plenty of time after scheduling the exam, so I procrastinated. Days turned into weeks, and November started slipping by. Occasionally, Iâ€™d sit down to study, but I wasnâ€™t consistent. Somewhere deep down, I knew I wasnâ€™t preparing well enough.  

When I finally began to take things seriously, I rescheduled the exam to November 30 to buy myself more time. That reschedule was a wake-up call. I told myself, *This isnâ€™t just about passing an exam; itâ€™s about truly mastering Kubernetes security.* That shift in mindset was the first step toward discipline.

### **Attempt 1: Time Management Struggles**  

November 30 arrived, and it was time for my first attempt. I had put in some good effort leading up to the day but was still not entirely confident. As I started the exam, I quickly realized how tough the revamped CKS is. Each of the 16 questions demanded focus, precision, and deep hands-on knowledge.  

I managed to complete 11 questions, but the remaining 5 were left untouched as the timer ran out. Time management was my biggest mistake. Instead of flagging tougher questions and coming back to them later, I spent too long trying to solve them in one go. When the results came in on Sunday, I wasnâ€™t surprisedâ€”I scored 58%, falling short of the 67% passing mark.

### **The Weekend of Reflection and Action**  

The failure stung, but it wasnâ€™t the end. Instead of sulking, I decided to act. I immediately rescheduled my second attempt for Monday, December 2. There wasnâ€™t much time, so I had to make every moment count.  

This time, preparation was different. I discovered my **KodeKloud subscription had expired**â€”a huge blow since I could no longer use their labs. Thankfully, the community stepped in. I found **Killer Coda**, a free platform that helped me practice scenarios. The platform wasnâ€™t perfect, but it gave me the hands-on practice I needed to regain confidence.  

I also revisited **killer.sh**, which I had used during my initial preparation. Unfortunately, I had already exhausted my two active sessions there. This limitation turned out to be a blessing in disguiseâ€”it forced me to focus on the knowledge and techniques I had already learned, rather than chasing new material.

### **Attempt 2: Out-Smarting the Exam**  

When Monday came, I was readyâ€”not just with knowledge but with a new strategy. I had learned from my mistakes. This time, I approached the exam with a smarter plan:  

- Instead of getting stuck on tough questions, I flagged them and moved on to the next.  
- This allowed me to complete all the questions first and return to the flagged ones later.  

The strategy worked wonders. I finished the exam with 20 minutes to spare, giving me enough time to review my work.  

When the results came in, I couldnâ€™t believe my eyesâ€”I scored 82%!

### **Lessons Learned**  

The CKS journey taught me more than Kubernetes security; it taught me the importance of discipline and consistency. I realized that success isnâ€™t about cramming or rushing at the last minute. Itâ€™s about showing up every day, even when you donâ€™t feel like it, and trusting the process.  

If youâ€™re preparing for the CKS exam, hereâ€™s my advice:  

1. **Be consistent**. Even if itâ€™s just an hour a day, keep at it.  
2. **Practice hands-on**. Platforms like Killer Coda and community-driven resources are invaluable.  
3. **Have a strategy**. Donâ€™t let time management be your downfall. Flag questions, move on, and come back later.  

The CKS is tough, but with the right mindset and preparation, you can conquer it. Trust me, if I can do it after failing the first attempt, so can you!  

Good luck, and happy learning! ðŸš€
