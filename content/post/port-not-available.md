**Yes, you read that right.** The port youâ€™re trying to use is already occupied by another application. If youâ€™re a system or network administrator, youâ€™ve likely encountered this frustrating message more times than you care to remember. Itâ€™s challenging to pinpoint which application is hogging the port (though itâ€™s not as hard as it seems, as Iâ€™ll show you ðŸ˜‰). These ghost messages can leave you in quite a pickle.

Just yesterday, we faced this exact issue and wasted two hours troubleshooting so that you donâ€™t have to!

Our situation was this: We had installed SQL Server 2019 Reporting Services on one of our development servers, and the default port it selected for installation was `8082`. Unfortunately, this port was already in use by our front-facing application, so we needed to free it up.

<img title="Port Not Available" alt="Port Not Available" src="/images/not listening.gif">

After some frantic Googling, we found a solution: we updated the port from `8082` to `8083` in the `config.json` file located in the Reporting Services folder. (You can usually find the file here: `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services\SSRS\RSHostingService\RSHostingService.exe`.) We then restarted the `SQL Server Reporting Services` Windows service, and voilÃ â€”`RSHostingService.exe` started running on port `8083`.

We thought everything was resolved and that port `8082` was free. However, when we configured our front-end application and tried to access it, we were greeted with a `503 Server Unavailable` error. ðŸ˜¢

## Troubleshooting Port Availability

To narrow down the issue, itâ€™s helpful to identify which application is using the port.

### Finding the Process Using `netstat`

The **netstat** command, short for "network statistics," is a command-line tool that displays active network connections, routing tables, and various network interface statistics. By running the `netstat` command with the `noa` parameters, we can list all the listening ports with process ID information and pipe that command to search for the specific port.

```cmd
netstat -noa | find "8082"
```

**Output:**
```
TCP    0.0.0.0:8082           0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING       4
TCP    [::]:8082              [::]:0                 LISTENING       4
```

The process ID `4` indicates that itâ€™s a system process. Unfortunately, this doesnâ€™t tell us which application is using the port, so we need another method.

### Finding the Process Using `netsh`

**Netsh**, short for **Network Shell**, is a command-line utility that allows users to configure and manage network devices both locally and remotely. Itâ€™s particularly useful for tasks like changing IP addresses, resetting the TCP/IP stack, and managing wireless settings.

We can use `netsh` to query the HTTP request and find out which process is using port `8082`:

```cmd
netsh http show servicestate view=requestq
```

Save the output of the above command to a file, open it using Notepad, and search for the port details:

```cmd
netsh http show servicestate view=requestq > results.log
notepad results.log
```

**Output:**
```
Request queue name: Request queue is unnamed.
    Version: 2.0
    State: Active
    Request queue 503 verbosity level: Basic
    Max requests: 1000
    Number of active processes attached: 1
    Process IDs:
        2312
    URL groups:
    URL group ID: BE00000340000001
        State: Active
        Request queue name: Request queue is unnamed.
        Properties:
            Max bandwidth: inherited
            Max connections: inherited
            Timeouts:
                Timeout values inherited
            Number of registered URLs: 1
            Registered URLs:
                HTTP://LOCALHOST:8082/
        Server session ID: C000000320000001
            Version: 2.0
            State: Active
            Properties:
                Max bandwidth: 4294967295
                Timeouts:
                    Entity body timeout (secs): 120
                    Drain entity body timeout (secs): 120
                    Request queue timeout (secs): 120
                    Idle connection timeout (secs): 120
                    Header wait timeout (secs): 120
                    Minimum send rate (bytes/sec): 150
```

Now you can see that port `8082` is being used by process `2312`. You can check Task Manager to see which process is associated with this PID, or use the following command:

```cmd
tasklist /FI "PID eq 2312"
```

**Output:**
```
Image Name                     PID Session Name        Session#    Mem Usage
========================= ======== ================ =========== ============
SQLServerReportingServices     2312 Services                   0     42,232 K
```

## What the Heck?! ðŸ˜®

How is this possible? We changed the reporting tool config file, yet `netsh` still shows that port `8082` is in use. Upon rechecking the reporting service logs, we confirmed that the application is indeed running on port `8083`. ðŸ¤”

It turns out that the URL with port `8082` was reserved by SQL Reporting Services with an Access Control List (ACL) during installation. Changing the config file alone wasnâ€™t enough. To see the list of URL reservations for HTTP services, use this command:

```cmd
netsh http show urlacl
```

**Output:**
```
 Reserved URL            : https://*:8082/
        User: NT SERVICE\SQLServerReportingServices
            Listen: Yes
            Delegate: No
            SDDL: D:(A;;GX;;;BU)(A;;GX;;;LS)
```

To free up port `8082` for our front-end application, we needed to delete this obsolete HTTP reservation:

```cmd
netsh http delete urlacl url=http://+:8082/
```

**Output:**
```
Deleted Successfully.
```

To confirm that the port is free and available for use, run:

```cmd
netstat -noa | find "8082"
```

The expected output should be blank! ðŸ˜‰

Finally, the port is free!
