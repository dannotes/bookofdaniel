      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earning the &lt;strong&gt;Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS)&lt;/strong&gt; was the next big goal on my Kubernetes journey after clearing &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookofdaniel.in/posts/how-my-15-month-old-baby-helped-me-pass-the-cka-exam/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CKA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookofdaniel.in/posts/passing-ckad-after-your-cka/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CKAD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; back in October. Riding high on the success of those certifications, I felt confident and scheduled the CKS for November. Little did I realize that this exam would challenge not just my Kubernetes skills but also my consistency and mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But thanks be to God!
He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Passing CKAD After Your CKA</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of Reddit users say that CKAD is easier than CKA. Personally, I agree‚Äîit does feel lighter if you attempt CKAD after completing CKA. The CKAD focuses more on scheduling tasks, while CKA involves administration of clusters. So, in CKAD, it&amp;rsquo;s more about speed and being quick with your typing to finish all the questions in time. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüïí&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-study-approach&#34;&gt;My Study Approach&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bookofdaniel.in/posts/how-my-15-month-old-baby-helped-me-pass-the-cka-exam/&#34;&gt;After passing the CKA two weeks earlier&lt;/a&gt;, I had a pretty good idea of what the exam interface and questions would be like. I compared the CKA and CKAD certifications to see what additional topics I needed to cover for CKAD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How My 15-Month-Old Baby Helped Me Pass the CKA Exam</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last November, I scheduled my CKA exam, but guess what? I kept putting it off for months. Every time I thought about studying Kubernetes, it felt like I was facing an enormous mountain I wasn‚Äôt ready to climb. Life got busy, I lost motivation, and the exam remained on hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, I bought the KodeKloud CKA course, thinking it would push me to start studying. I studied a little, then stopped, and this cycle went on for weeks. Kubernetes seemed too big and complex to handle, and I didn‚Äôt know where to begin. And then, life happened‚Äîmy father was hospitalized, and I had even less drive to study.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why Am Wearing Same Outfit Everyday</title>

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Minimalism is not about having less. It&amp;rsquo;s about making room for more of what matters.&amp;rdquo; - Unknown&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first explored minimalism, I was struck by a pattern: many minimalists, myself included, often opt for a simple, repeatable outfit, such as a black t-shirt. Initially, this seemed almost like a uniform. But diving deeper into minimalism, I understood the profound reasons behind this choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-understanding-minimalism&#34;&gt;üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Understanding Minimalism:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minimalism is more than a fashion statement; it&amp;rsquo;s a mindset that encourages us to find beauty and satisfaction in simplicity. It&amp;rsquo;s about stripping away the non-essential to make room for what truly adds value to our lives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Unstoppable Framework: A Step-by-Step Guide to Achieving Your Goals</title>
      <link>https://bookofdaniel.in/posts/the-unstoppable-framework/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We all aspire to be better, stronger, smarter, and healthier, yet many struggle to stick with their goals. In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore a practical framework that addresses this common issue, allowing you to effortlessly surpass your goals. This system has been successfully used to develop the discipline needed to hold a 15-minute plank every day. Join me on this journey, and let&amp;rsquo;s unlock your raw power together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-1-action-oriented-goals&#34;&gt;Step 1: Action-Oriented Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of setting vague and impractical goals, focus on specific actions within a defined time frame. For instance, rather than aiming to lose 20 pounds, set a goal to complete 10,000 push-ups by the end of the year. Break down the goal into actionable steps, visualize each step, and establish a non-negotiable daily minimum to make progress.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the high-speed hustle of modern professional life, we often find ourselves chasing time, trying to grasp every fleeting minute.

If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, a busy professional always on the lookout for the best way to streamline your day, you know that most productivity systems seem to add more to our plates rather than taking off the load.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Reclaiming Our Digital Space: The Rise of NOSTR and the Renaissance of Social Media üí™üèª</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The early days of the internet were marked by a sense of freedom and innovation. Platforms like Twitter, founded by Jack Dorsey and others, were initially open-source ecosystems where developers could contribute, leading to features like hashtags and trending topics. This era was characterized by decentralized protocols, like email, allowing for diverse applications and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Google grew, they started organizing this vast information, turning social media into centralized repositories. This shift was efficient but led to the accumulation of power in the hands of a few companies, creating &amp;lsquo;walled gardens&amp;rsquo; where user data became a commodity for advertising revenue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the hustle and bustle of our daily lives, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to let moments slip by without much thought.

But what if I told you there&amp;rsquo;s a way to reap the benefits of journaling in just five minutes a day? Enter the 5-Minute Death Journal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Picture it: your bed, a chaotic landscape of tangled limbs and rogue pillows, mirroring the state of your life. Enter &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._McRaven&#34;&gt;Admiral William McRaven&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.in/Make-Your-Bed-William-McRaven/dp/0718188861&#34;&gt;Make Your Bed&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;rdquo; a book that&amp;rsquo;s anything but your average fluff-and-fold self-help manual. Think less feng shui, more forging a battle cry in the crucible of Navy SEAL training. This ain&amp;rsquo;t about smoothing out your duvet; it&amp;rsquo;s about scaling metaphorical Mount Everest, one messy pillowcase at a time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey there, fellow knowledge seekers! üöÄ Recently, I stumbled upon an incredibly inspiring YouTube video that reshaped my entire approach to focus and productivity. In this blog post, I&amp;rsquo;ll distill the essence of this video into a cool, easily digestible guide. Trust me, it&amp;rsquo;s not your typical &amp;ldquo;how-to&amp;rdquo; list; it&amp;rsquo;s a game-changer! (P.S. Check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/Pe-iBysIb7o&#34;&gt;original video&lt;/a&gt; here for the full experience!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-create-your-sacred-space-&#34;&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Create Your Sacred Space&lt;/strong&gt; üåå&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step is to designate a &amp;ldquo;Sacred Space&amp;rdquo; - a special area used solely for studying or working. Imagine it as a holy box where productivity reigns supreme. Once you enter this space, work begins - no exceptions! This approach mirrors insomnia research, teaching you to associate certain places with specific activities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During the COVID-19 lockdown, people had differing views: some felt it could be the end, while others saw it as an opportunity to start something new.
