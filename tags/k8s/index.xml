      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earning the &lt;strong&gt;Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS)&lt;/strong&gt; was the next big goal on my Kubernetes journey after clearing &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookofdaniel.in/posts/how-my-15-month-old-baby-helped-me-pass-the-cka-exam/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CKA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookofdaniel.in/posts/passing-ckad-after-your-cka/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CKAD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; back in October. Riding high on the success of those certifications, I felt confident and scheduled the CKS for November. Little did I realize that this exam would challenge not just my Kubernetes skills but also my consistency and mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-lazy-start&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Lazy Start&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, my preparation was half-hearted. I had plenty of time after scheduling the exam, so I procrastinated. Days turned into weeks, and November started slipping by. Occasionally, I‚Äôd sit down to study, but I wasn‚Äôt consistent. Somewhere deep down, I knew I wasn‚Äôt preparing well enough.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Passing CKAD After Your CKA</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of Reddit users say that CKAD is easier than CKA. Personally, I agree‚Äîit does feel lighter if you attempt CKAD after completing CKA. The CKAD focuses more on scheduling tasks, while CKA involves administration of clusters. So, in CKAD, it&amp;rsquo;s more about speed and being quick with your typing to finish all the questions in time. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüïí&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-study-approach&#34;&gt;My Study Approach&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bookofdaniel.in/posts/how-my-15-month-old-baby-helped-me-pass-the-cka-exam/&#34;&gt;After passing the CKA two weeks earlier&lt;/a&gt;, I had a pretty good idea of what the exam interface and questions would be like. I compared the CKA and CKAD certifications to see what additional topics I needed to cover for CKAD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How My 15-Month-Old Baby Helped Me Pass the CKA Exam</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last November, I scheduled my CKA exam, but guess what? I kept putting it off for months. Every time I thought about studying Kubernetes, it felt like I was facing an enormous mountain I wasn‚Äôt ready to climb. Life got busy, I lost motivation, and the exam remained on hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, I bought the KodeKloud CKA course, thinking it would push me to start studying. I studied a little, then stopped, and this cycle went on for weeks. Kubernetes seemed too big and complex to handle, and I didn‚Äôt know where to begin. And then, life happened‚Äîmy father was hospitalized, and I had even less drive to study.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to our exploration of Kubernetes architecture! Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s, is a powerful tool designed to manage containerized applications in a scalable and automated fashion. This blog post aims to provide a high-level understanding of Kubernetes architecture using an analogy of ships, which simplifies the complex interplay between its components. Special thanks to KodeKloud for their insightful lecture, which inspired this overview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-kubernetes-cluster-ships-at-sea&#34;&gt;The Kubernetes Cluster: Ships at Sea&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its core, a Kubernetes cluster comprises two types of nodes: worker nodes and master nodes. To understand their roles, let&amp;rsquo;s imagine a fleet of ships:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
