      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last November, I scheduled my CKA exam, but guess what? I kept putting it off for months. Every time I thought about studying Kubernetes, it felt like I was facing an enormous mountain I wasn’t ready to climb. Life got busy, I lost motivation, and the exam remained on hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, I bought the KodeKloud CKA course, thinking it would push me to start studying. I studied a little, then stopped, and this cycle went on for weeks. Kubernetes seemed too big and complex to handle, and I didn’t know where to begin. And then, life happened—my father was hospitalized, and I had even less drive to study.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to our exploration of Kubernetes architecture! Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s, is a powerful tool designed to manage containerized applications in a scalable and automated fashion. This blog post aims to provide a high-level understanding of Kubernetes architecture using an analogy of ships, which simplifies the complex interplay between its components. Special thanks to KodeKloud for their insightful lecture, which inspired this overview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-kubernetes-cluster-ships-at-sea&#34;&gt;The Kubernetes Cluster: Ships at Sea&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its core, a Kubernetes cluster comprises two types of nodes: worker nodes and master nodes. To understand their roles, let&amp;rsquo;s imagine a fleet of ships:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
