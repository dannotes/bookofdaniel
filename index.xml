      <title>Passing CKAD After Your CKA</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of Reddit users say that CKAD is easier than CKA. Personally, I agree‚Äîit does feel lighter if you attempt CKAD after completing CKA. The CKAD focuses more on scheduling tasks, while CKA involves administration of clusters. So, in CKAD, it&amp;rsquo;s more about speed and being quick with your typing to finish all the questions in time. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüïí&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-study-approach&#34;&gt;My Study Approach&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bookofdaniel.in/posts/how-my-15-month-old-baby-helped-me-pass-the-cka-exam/&#34;&gt;After passing the CKA two weeks earlier&lt;/a&gt;, I had a pretty good idea of what the exam interface and questions would be like. I compared the CKA and CKAD certifications to see what additional topics I needed to cover for CKAD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How My 15-Month-Old Baby Helped Me Pass the CKA Exam</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last November, I scheduled my CKA exam, but guess what? I kept putting it off for months. Every time I thought about studying Kubernetes, it felt like I was facing an enormous mountain I wasn‚Äôt ready to climb. Life got busy, I lost motivation, and the exam remained on hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, I bought the KodeKloud CKA course, thinking it would push me to start studying. I studied a little, then stopped, and this cycle went on for weeks. Kubernetes seemed too big and complex to handle, and I didn‚Äôt know where to begin. And then, life happened‚Äîmy father was hospitalized, and I had even less drive to study.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>SSL Pinning: Safeguarding Your App Against Man-in-the-Middle Attacks</title>
      <link>https://bookofdaniel.in/posts/ssl-pinning/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 17:13:56 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>https://bookofdaniel.in/posts/ssl-pinning/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2014, security researchers discovered a critical vulnerability in the HSBC mobile banking app for iOS. The app was found to be susceptible to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, allowing attackers to intercept and manipulate sensitive financial information. The root of the problem? The absence of SSL pinning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without SSL pinning, the app was vulnerable to accepting any SSL certificate, even a forged one, which enabled attackers to eavesdrop on the communication between the app and HSBC&amp;rsquo;s servers. This security flaw put users&amp;rsquo; banking information at risk and highlighted a significant gap in the app&amp;rsquo;s security framework.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Kafka Explained: The Post Office of Modern Data Streaming</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Joshua had been waiting anxiously for weeks. As an aspiring clerk, he knew that the government official&amp;rsquo;s appointment order could arrive any day. This appointment was crucial‚Äîit would determine his future and career. Every morning, Joshua checked his local post office, hoping that today would be the day the letter arrived, confirming his new position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, Joshua‚Äôs experience mirrors how Kafka, a powerful distributed streaming platform, manages and delivers data. Just like how Joshua relies on the postal system to receive his appointment letter, modern data systems depend on Kafka to ensure that critical information reaches its intended recipients quickly and reliably.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Minimalism is not about having less. It&amp;rsquo;s about making room for more of what matters.&amp;rdquo; - Unknown&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first explored minimalism, I was struck by a pattern: many minimalists, myself included, often opt for a simple, repeatable outfit, such as a black t-shirt. Initially, this seemed almost like a uniform. But diving deeper into minimalism, I understood the profound reasons behind this choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-understanding-minimalism&#34;&gt;üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Understanding Minimalism:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minimalism is more than a fashion statement; it&amp;rsquo;s a mindset that encourages us to find beauty and satisfaction in simplicity. It&amp;rsquo;s about stripping away the non-essential to make room for what truly adds value to our lives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Unstoppable Framework: A Step-by-Step Guide to Achieving Your Goals</title>
      <link>https://bookofdaniel.in/posts/the-unstoppable-framework/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We all aspire to be better, stronger, smarter, and healthier, yet many struggle to stick with their goals. In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore a practical framework that addresses this common issue, allowing you to effortlessly surpass your goals. This system has been successfully used to develop the discipline needed to hold a 15-minute plank every day. Join me on this journey, and let&amp;rsquo;s unlock your raw power together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-1-action-oriented-goals&#34;&gt;Step 1: Action-Oriented Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of setting vague and impractical goals, focus on specific actions within a defined time frame. For instance, rather than aiming to lose 20 pounds, set a goal to complete 10,000 push-ups by the end of the year. Break down the goal into actionable steps, visualize each step, and establish a non-negotiable daily minimum to make progress.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the high-speed hustle of modern professional life, we often find ourselves chasing time, trying to grasp every fleeting minute.

If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, a busy professional always on the lookout for the best way to streamline your day, you know that most productivity systems seem to add more to our plates rather than taking off the load.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Reclaiming Our Digital Space: The Rise of NOSTR and the Renaissance of Social Media üí™üèª</title>

      <guid>https://bookofdaniel.in/posts/the-rise-of-nostr-and-the-renaissance-of-social-media/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The early days of the internet were marked by a sense of freedom and innovation. Platforms like Twitter, founded by Jack Dorsey and others, were initially open-source ecosystems where developers could contribute, leading to features like hashtags and trending topics. This era was characterized by decentralized protocols, like email, allowing for diverse applications and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Google grew, they started organizing this vast information, turning social media into centralized repositories. This shift was efficient but led to the accumulation of power in the hands of a few companies, creating &amp;lsquo;walled gardens&amp;rsquo; where user data became a commodity for advertising revenue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the hustle and bustle of our daily lives, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to let moments slip by without much thought.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, you read that right.&lt;/strong&gt; The port you‚Äôre trying to use is already occupied by another application. If you‚Äôre a system or network administrator, you‚Äôve likely encountered this frustrating message more times than you care to remember. It‚Äôs challenging to pinpoint which application is hogging the port (though it‚Äôs not as hard as it seems, as I‚Äôll show you üòâ). These ghost messages can leave you in quite a pickle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Picture it: your bed, a chaotic landscape of tangled limbs and rogue pillows, mirroring the state of your life. Enter &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._McRaven&#34;&gt;Admiral William McRaven&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.in/Make-Your-Bed-William-McRaven/dp/0718188861&#34;&gt;Make Your Bed&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;rdquo; a book that&amp;rsquo;s anything but your average fluff-and-fold self-help manual. Think less feng shui, more forging a battle cry in the crucible of Navy SEAL training. This ain&amp;rsquo;t about smoothing out your duvet; it&amp;rsquo;s about scaling metaphorical Mount Everest, one messy pillowcase at a time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to our exploration of Kubernetes architecture! Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s, is a powerful tool designed to manage containerized applications in a scalable and automated fashion. This blog post aims to provide a high-level understanding of Kubernetes architecture using an analogy of ships, which simplifies the complex interplay between its components. Special thanks to KodeKloud for their insightful lecture, which inspired this overview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-kubernetes-cluster-ships-at-sea&#34;&gt;The Kubernetes Cluster: Ships at Sea&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its core, a Kubernetes cluster comprises two types of nodes: worker nodes and master nodes. To understand their roles, let&amp;rsquo;s imagine a fleet of ships:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In the dynamic world of cloud computing, the term &amp;lsquo;cloud-native architecture&amp;rsquo; is often synonymous with innovation and efficiency. This article, inspired by a Google Cloud blog post, expands the concept to encompass universal principles applicable across all cloud platforms, be it Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP). üå¶Ô∏èüèóÔ∏è&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;understanding-cloud-native-architecture&#34;&gt;Understanding Cloud-Native Architecture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud-native architecture is about leveraging the unique capabilities of cloud environments. It goes beyond mere migration to the cloud; it&amp;rsquo;s about optimizing applications to thrive in this dynamic ecosystem. üå©Ô∏èüí°&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Installing Kafka and Kafka Connect on separate servers allows for better resource management, especially in production environments where Kafka brokers and Connectors may need dedicated hardware. This guide will walk you through the steps to set up Kafka and Kafka Connect on separate Linux servers, using Ubuntu 24.04.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;prerequisites&#34;&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two Linux machines&lt;/strong&gt; (Ubuntu 24.04)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inbound ports opened&lt;/strong&gt; on both servers:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kafka broker ports: 9092, 9093&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kafka Connect REST port: 8083&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey there, fellow knowledge seekers! üöÄ Recently, I stumbled upon an incredibly inspiring YouTube video that reshaped my entire approach to focus and productivity. In this blog post, I&amp;rsquo;ll distill the essence of this video into a cool, easily digestible guide. Trust me, it&amp;rsquo;s not your typical &amp;ldquo;how-to&amp;rdquo; list; it&amp;rsquo;s a game-changer! (P.S. Check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/Pe-iBysIb7o&#34;&gt;original video&lt;/a&gt; here for the full experience!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-create-your-sacred-space-&#34;&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Create Your Sacred Space&lt;/strong&gt; üåå&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step is to designate a &amp;ldquo;Sacred Space&amp;rdquo; - a special area used solely for studying or working. Imagine it as a holy box where productivity reigns supreme. Once you enter this space, work begins - no exceptions! This approach mirrors insomnia research, teaching you to associate certain places with specific activities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a world where technology is ever-evolving, programmers are constantly seeking ways to enhance their skills and productivity. A treasure trove of wisdom that is often overlooked in the tech community is Stephen Covey&amp;rsquo;s iconic book, &amp;ldquo;7 Habits of Highly Effective People.&amp;rdquo; Sahil, a YouTuber, sheds light on how this book can be a game-changer for programmers aspiring to amplify their effectiveness tenfold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;1-the-essence-of-proactivity-in-programming&#34;&gt;1. The Essence of Proactivity in Programming&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covey distinguishes between reactive and proactive individuals, drawing a parallel with programmers. Reactive programmers might wait for a life-changing tutorial or a list of interview questions to boost their career. In contrast, proactive programmers take ownership of their growth. They invest time in understanding the fundamentals, practicing coding, and building projects. This mindset shift from dependency to self-reliance is crucial for any programmer aiming for excellence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the cold winter of 1944, Germany‚Äôs once-unbreakable &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine&#34;&gt;Enigma&lt;/a&gt; code had been compromised by the Allies. With every intercepted message, their plans were at risk of exposure, and entire operations could be jeopardized. In response, German High Command devised a new, unbreakable system of communication. They called it &lt;strong&gt;Operation Valkyrie&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wasn‚Äôt just another machine like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine&#34;&gt;Enigma&lt;/a&gt;; this was a new system that couldn‚Äôt be cracked, even if the messages were intercepted. Colonel Franz Richter, a seasoned officer in charge of communications, knew that their most sensitive military orders would need to be protected more securely than ever. He gathered his top commanders, including Major Klaus Weber, to unveil the system that could change the course of the war.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
