You should see k8s-master and k8s-worker1 with the correct IP addresses and machine types.\nSystem Preparation for Kubernetes Installation Before diving into the installation of Kubernetes, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to prepare your system for optimal performance and stability. This section outlines the necessary steps to get both the master and worker nodes ready for Kubernetes.\nℹ️ Execute the following commands on both master and worker nodes.\n1. Update the OS First, ensure your system is up-to-date by running the following commands to update and upgrade all installed packages:\nsudo apt update sudo apt upgrade -y After the upgrade completes, reboot the system to apply all changes:\nsudo reboot 2. Set Hostname Assign meaningful hostnames to both your master and worker nodes. This makes it easier to identify and manage the nodes in your cluster.\nMaster Node: sudo hostnamectl set-hostname \u0026#34;k8s-master.local\u0026#34; Worker Node: sudo hostnamectl set-hostname \u0026#34;k8s-worker1.local\u0026#34; Next, update the /etc/hosts file on both nodes to map the hostnames to their corresponding IP addresses. Add the following lines to the file:\n172.16.39.14 k8s-master.local 172.16.39.23 k8s-worker1.local 3. Disable Swap Kubernetes requires swap to be disabled to function properly. This is crucial because the Kubelet, the primary Kubernetes agent running on each node, does not handle memory swapping well. Enabling swap can lead to performance degradation and unpredictable behavior in your cluster.\nDisable swap immediately with the following commands:\nsudo swapoff -a sudo sed -i \u0026#39;/ swap / s/^/#/\u0026#39; /etc/fstab sudo mount -a By commenting out the swap entry in /etc/fstab, this ensures swap remains disabled after a reboot. Verify swap is disabled with:\nfree -h The output should indicate that swap is set to 0:\ntotal used free shared buff/cache available Mem: 7.8Gi 1.4Gi 4.9Gi 5.0Mi 1.7Gi 6.3Gi Swap: 0B 0B 0B 4. Update Kernel and Configure Modules For Kubernetes to run efficiently, specific kernel modules and network parameters need to be configured.\nFirst, create a configuration file for kernel modules:\nsudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/containerd.conf \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF overlay br_netfilter EOF overlay: Used for overlay filesystems, which are essential for container storage. br_netfilter: Enables Kubernetes to manage network traffic between containers. Next, load the required kernel modules:\nsudo modprobe overlay sudo modprobe br_netfilter Set the necessary kernel parameters for Kubernetes by creating a configuration file:\nsudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/kubernetes.conf \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1 net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 1 net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1 EOF Finally, reload the sysctl configuration to apply the new parameters:\nsudo sysctl --system These steps ensure your system is properly prepared for the Kubernetes installation, providing a stable foundation for the cluster to run efficiently.\nInstalling Containerd Runtime on All Nodes A critical component of any Kubernetes cluster is the container runtime, which is responsible for running containers on each node. Containerd is a lightweight and powerful runtime that provides essential container lifecycle management, including image transfer, storage, and execution. Originally developed as part of Docker, it is now a key part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and is favored for Kubernetes environments due to its simplicity and performance.\nTo install containerd on all nodes in your Kubernetes cluster, follow these steps:\nFirst, ensure that the necessary packages and dependencies are installed:\nsudo apt install -y curl gnupg2 software-properties-common apt-transport-https ca-certificates Add Docker’s official GPG key and Docker’s repository to your system:\nsudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmour -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/docker.gpg sudo add-apt-repository \u0026#34;deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable\u0026#34; Update your package lists to include the newly added Docker repository, and install containerd:\nsudo apt update sudo apt install -y containerd.io Once containerd is installed, you need to configure it to work with Kubernetes. Generate the default configuration file and enable SystemdCgroup, which ensures that containerd integrates smoothly with Kubernetes, particularly when using systemd for process management:\ncontainerd config default | sudo tee /etc/containerd/config.toml \u0026gt;/dev/null 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1 sudo sed -i \u0026#39;s/SystemdCgroup = false/SystemdCgroup = true/g\u0026#39; /etc/containerd/config.toml Finally, restart and enable the containerd service so that it starts automatically on system boot:\nsudo systemctl restart containerd sudo systemctl enable containerd By following these steps, you’ll have a robust and efficient container runtime in place, ready for Kubernetes. Repeat this process on each node to ensure consistency across the cluster.\nInstalling Kubeadm, Kubelet, and Kubectl Now that your system is prepared, it\u0026rsquo;s time to install the essential Kubernetes components on all of your machines: kubeadm, kubelet, and kubectl.\nkubeadm: This tool helps bootstrap the Kubernetes cluster. kubelet: The agent that runs on all nodes in the cluster, responsible for running pods and containers. kubectl: A command-line utility that lets you interact with the Kubernetes cluster. It\u0026rsquo;s important to note that kubeadm will not manage or install kubelet or kubectl for you, so you must ensure that all these tools are on the correct version. Mismatches between kubeadm, kubelet, and kubectl versions can result in instability. Kubernetes does allow a one-minor-version difference between the kubelet and the control plane, but the kubelet version should never exceed the API server version. For example, kubelet v1.7.0 can work with an API server running v1.8.0, but not the other way around.\nAdditionally, as of September 13, 2023, Kubernetes has moved to a new package repository hosted at pkgs.k8s.io, which you must use to install any Kubernetes versions after v1.24. The legacy repositories (apt.kubernetes.io) are deprecated and may be removed without notice.\nFollow the steps below to install these packages for Kubernetes v1.31:\n1. Update Package Index and Install Dependencies Start by updating the system’s package index and installing the necessary dependencies:\nsudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gpg 2. Add the Kubernetes Signing Key Download the Kubernetes signing key for the package repositories. If the directory /etc/apt/keyrings doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, create it before running the following command:\ncurl -fsSL https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.31/deb/Release.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg This ensures that you are installing authentic Kubernetes packages.\n3. Add the Kubernetes v1.31 Repository Add the Kubernetes v1.31 repository to your system’s sources list. If you need a different version, modify the version number in the URL accordingly:\necho \u0026#39;deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg] https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.31/deb/ /\u0026#39; | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list 4. Install Kubelet, Kubeadm, and Kubectl Once the repository is added, update your package list and install kubeadm, kubelet, and kubectl:\nsudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl Marking the packages with apt-mark hold ensures they won\u0026rsquo;t be accidentally updated during system upgrades, which is important for maintaining version stability across your cluster.\n5. Enable the Kubelet Service (Optional) Before you bootstrap the Kubernetes cluster with kubeadm, you can enable the kubelet service to start automatically on boot:\nsudo systemctl enable --now kubelet These steps install the core tools required for setting up and managing your Kubernetes cluster. Make sure to follow them carefully on both your master and worker nodes.\nHere’s the blog paragraph based on your snippet:\nInitializing the Kubernetes Cluster with Kubeadm With kubeadm, kubelet, and kubectl installed on your master and worker nodes, it’s time to initialize the Kubernetes cluster.\nℹ️ This step should only be executed on the master node, as it sets up the control plane that will manage the cluster.\nTo begin, use the following command on your master node to initialize the cluster:\nsudo kubeadm init \\ --pod-network-cidr=10.10.0.0/16 \\ --control-plane-endpoint=k8s-master.local \u0026ndash;pod-network-cidr=10.10.0.0/16: This specifies the CIDR range for the pod network. You can modify this value based on your network architecture. \u0026ndash;control-plane-endpoint=k8s-master.local: This is the DNS or IP address of your control plane (master node). Ensure that the DNS or IP is resolvable by all worker nodes in your cluster. After running this command, kubeadm will perform the following tasks:\nDownload and install the necessary control plane components such as etcd, kube-apiserver, kube-scheduler, and kube-controller-manager. Set up your cluster according to the parameters provided. Generate a join token that worker nodes can use to join the cluster. Once the initialization is complete, kubeadm will output instructions to finish setting up kubectl on the master node and provide the join command for your worker nodes.\nNotes:\nThe --pod-network-cidr value must align with the configuration of the pod network solution (e.g., Calico, Flannel) you plan to deploy. Make sure that the control plane endpoint (k8s-master.local) is properly configured in your DNS or /etc/hosts file so that all nodes can resolve it. At this point, the control plane will be ready, and the next step will be to install a network add-on to allow pod-to-pod communication within the cluster.\nOutput:\nazureuser@k8s-master:~$ sudo kubeadm init \\ --pod-network-cidr=10.10.0.0/16 \\ --control-plane-endpoint=k8s-master.local [init] Using Kubernetes version: v1.26.1 [preflight] Running pre-flight checks [preflight] Pulling images required for setting up a Kubernetes cluster [preflight] This might take a minute or two, depending on the speed of your internet connection [preflight] You can also perform this action in beforehand using \u0026#39;kubeadm config images pull\u0026#39; [certs] Using certificateDir folder \u0026#34;/etc/kubernetes/pki\u0026#34; [certs] Generating \u0026#34;ca\u0026#34; certificate and key [certs] Generating \u0026#34;apiserver\u0026#34; certificate and key [certs] apiserver serving cert is signed for DNS names [k8s-master.local kubernetes kubernetes.default kubernetes.default.svc kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local] and IPs [10.96.0.1 192.168.1.10] [certs] Generating \u0026#34;apiserver-kubelet-client\u0026#34; certificate and key [certs] Generating \u0026#34;front-proxy-ca\u0026#34; certificate and key [certs] Generating \u0026#34;front-proxy-client\u0026#34; certificate and key [certs] Generating \u0026#34;etcd/ca\u0026#34; certificate and key [certs] Generating \u0026#34;etcd/server\u0026#34; certificate and key [certs] etcd/server serving cert is signed for DNS names [k8s-master.local localhost] and IPs [192.168.1.10 127.0.0.1 ::1] [certs] Generating \u0026#34;etcd/peer\u0026#34; certificate and key [certs] etcd/peer serving cert is signed for DNS names [k8s-master.local localhost] and IPs [192.168.1.10 127.0.0.1 ::1] [certs] Generating \u0026#34;etcd/healthcheck-client\u0026#34; certificate and key [certs] Generating \u0026#34;apiserver-etcd-client\u0026#34; certificate and key [certs] Generating \u0026#34;sa\u0026#34; key and public key [kubeconfig] Using kubeconfig folder \u0026#34;/etc/kubernetes\u0026#34; [kubeconfig] Writing \u0026#34;admin.conf\u0026#34; kubeconfig file [kubeconfig] Writing \u0026#34;kubelet.conf\u0026#34; kubeconfig file [kubeconfig] Writing \u0026#34;controller-manager.conf\u0026#34; kubeconfig file [kubeconfig] Writing \u0026#34;scheduler.conf\u0026#34; kubeconfig file [kubelet-start] Writing kubelet environment file with flags to file \u0026#34;/var/lib/kubelet/kubeadm-flags.env\u0026#34; [kubelet-start] Writing kubelet configuration to file \u0026#34;/var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml\u0026#34; [kubelet-start] Starting the kubelet [control-plane] Using manifest folder \u0026#34;/etc/kubernetes/manifests\u0026#34; [control-plane] Creating static Pod manifest for \u0026#34;kube-apiserver\u0026#34; [control-plane] Creating static Pod manifest for \u0026#34;kube-controller-manager\u0026#34; [control-plane] Creating static Pod manifest for \u0026#34;kube-scheduler\u0026#34; [etcd] Creating static Pod manifest for local etcd in \u0026#34;/etc/kubernetes/manifests\u0026#34; [wait-control-plane] Waiting for the kubelet to boot up the control plane as static Pods from directory \u0026#34;/etc/kubernetes/manifests\u0026#34;.

This will allow the control plane to distribute workloads across the nodes and manage them.\nℹ️ To add a worker node, you need to execute the kubeadm join command in worker nodes.\nThis command securely connects the worker node to the control plane. the command typically looks something like this:\nkubeadm join k8s-master.local:6443 --token daii9y.g4dq24u6irkz4pt0 \\ --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:58b9cc96ed57a5797fddea653756dbda830efbff55b720a10cffb3948d489148 k8s-master.local:6443: This is the control plane endpoint (master node\u0026rsquo;s address). \u0026ndash;token: The token generated during the kubeadm init process, which allows the worker node to authenticate with the control plane. \u0026ndash;discovery-token-ca-cert-hash: A hash that ensures the worker node securely discovers the control plane’s certificate authority. Once this command completes successfully, the worker node will be part of the Kubernetes cluster, ready to run workloads distributed by the control plane. You can verify that the node has joined the cluster by running the following command on the master node:\nkubectl get nodes Output:\nazureuser@k8s-master:~$ kubectl get nodes NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION k8s-master.local Ready control-plane 3d3h v1.30.4 k8s-worker1.local Ready \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 3d3h v1.30.4 This will list all nodes, including the newly added workers, along with their status in the cluster.\nRepeat the process for each worker node to ensure that all machines are part of the cluster.\nHere’s the updated blog paragraph with the sed command for editing the Calico manifest:\nInstalling Calico (v3.28.1) Pod Network for the Kubernetes Cluster In order to allow communication between the pods in your cluster, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to install a network add-on. One of the most popular options is Calico, which provides networking and network security capabilities for Kubernetes. Below, we\u0026rsquo;ll walk through how to install Calico on your Kubernetes cluster.\nℹ️ These commands should be run only on the master node.\n1. Download the Calico Manifest File To begin, download the Calico manifest file, which is pre-configured for clusters with fewer than 50 nodes:\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/v3.28.1/manifests/calico.yaml -O This file contains all the necessary configuration to deploy Calico on your Kubernetes cluster.\n2. Edit the Calico Manifest Using sed To streamline the process of modifying the CALICO_IPV4POOL_CIDR in the calico.yaml file, you can use the following sed command. This automatically updates the pod network CIDR without manually opening the file:\nsed -i \u0026#39;s/value: \u0026#34;192.168.0.0\\/16\u0026#34;/value: \u0026#34;10.10.0.0\\/16\u0026#34;/\u0026#39; calico.yaml This command ensures that the pod network CIDR matches the one you specified during cluster initialization (10.10.0.0/16).\n3. Apply the Calico Manifest Once the manifest is updated, install Calico by applying the configuration using kubectl:\nkubectl apply -f calico.yaml Calico will be deployed on your cluster, enabling pod-to-pod communication and enforcing network policies.\nOutput:\nazureuser@k8s-master:~$ kubectl apply -f calico.yaml poddisruptionbudget.policy/calico-kube-controllers created serviceaccount/calico-kube-controllers created serviceaccount/calico-node created configmap/calico-config created customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/bgpconfigurations.crd.projectcalico.org created customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/bgppeers.crd.projectcalico.org created customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/blockaffinities.crd.projectcalico.org created customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/caliconodestatuses.crd.projectcalico.org created customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/clusterinformations.crd.projectcalico.org created customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/felixconfigurations.crd.projectcalico.org created customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/globalnetworkpolicies.crd.projectcalico.org created customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/globalnetworksets.crd.projectcalico.org created customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/hostendpoints.crd.projectcalico.org created customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/ipamblocks.crd.projectcalico.org created customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/ipamconfigs.crd.projectcalico.org created customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/ipamhandles.crd.projectcalico.org created customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/ippools.crd.projectcalico.org created customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/ipreservations.crd.projectcalico.org created customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/kubecontrollersconfigurations.crd.projectcalico.org created customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/networkpolicies.crd.projectcalico.org created customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/networksets.crd.projectcalico.org created clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/calico-kube-controllers created clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/calico-node created clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/calico-kube-controllers created clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/calico-node created daemonset.apps/calico-node created deployment.apps/calico-kube-controllers created Verifying the K8s Installation You can verify that Calico is running correctly by checking the status of the pods in the kube-system namespace:\nkubectl get pods -n kube-system Output:\nazureuser@k8s-master:~$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE calico-kube-controllers-77d59654f4-25crd 1/1 Running 5 (3h59m ago) 3d3h calico-node-hqf82 1/1 Running 2 (3h59m ago) 3d3h calico-node-jxwbm 1/1 Running 4 (3h55m ago) 3d3h coredns-7db6d8ff4d-6f9cn 1/1 Running 2 (3h59m ago) 3d4h coredns-7db6d8ff4d-dnzq2 1/1 Running 2 (3h59m ago) 3d4h You should see Calico components such as calico-node and calico-kube-controllers running successfully.\nWith Calico installed, your Kubernetes cluster is now fully networked, allowing pods to communicate across nodes as necessary.

The port you’re trying to use is already occupied by another application. If you’re a system or network administrator, you’ve likely encountered this frustrating message more times than you care to remember. It’s challenging to pinpoint which application is hogging the port (though it’s not as hard as it seems, as I’ll show you 😉). These ghost messages can leave you in quite a pickle.\nJust yesterday, we faced this exact issue and wasted two hours troubleshooting so that you don’t have to!\nOur situation was this: We had installed SQL Server 2019 Reporting Services on one of our development servers, and the default port it selected for installation was 8082. Unfortunately, this port was already in use by our front-facing application, so we needed to free it up.\nAfter some frantic Googling, we found a solution: we updated the port from 8082 to 8083 in the config.json file located in the Reporting Services folder. (You can usually find the file here: C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services\\SSRS\\RSHostingService\\RSHostingService.exe.) We then restarted the SQL Server Reporting Services Windows service, and voilà—RSHostingService.exe started running on port 8083.\nWe thought everything was resolved and that port 8082 was free. However, when we configured our front-end application and tried to access it, we were greeted with a 503 Server Unavailable error. 😢\nTroubleshooting Port Availability To narrow down the issue, it’s helpful to identify which application is using the port.\nFinding the Process Using netstat The netstat command, short for \u0026ldquo;network statistics,\u0026rdquo; is a command-line tool that displays active network connections, routing tables, and various network interface statistics. By running the netstat command with the noa parameters, we can list all the listening ports with process ID information and pipe that command to search for the specific port.\nnetstat -noa | find \u0026#34;8082\u0026#34; Output:\nTCP 0.0.0.0:8082 0.0.0.0:0 LISTENING 4 TCP [::]:8082 [::]:0 LISTENING 4 The process ID 4 indicates that it’s a system process. Unfortunately, this doesn’t tell us which application is using the port, so we need another method.\nFinding the Process Using netsh Netsh, short for Network Shell, is a command-line utility that allows users to configure and manage network devices both locally and remotely. It’s particularly useful for tasks like changing IP addresses, resetting the TCP/IP stack, and managing wireless settings.\nWe can use netsh to query the HTTP request and find out which process is using port 8082:\nnetsh http show servicestate view=requestq Save the output of the above command to a file, open it using Notepad, and search for the port details:\nnetsh http show servicestate view=requestq \u0026gt; results.log notepad results.log Output:\nRequest queue name: Request queue is unnamed.

You can check Task Manager to see which process is associated with this PID, or use the following command:\ntasklist /FI \u0026#34;PID eq 2312\u0026#34; Output:\nImage Name PID Session Name Session# Mem Usage ========================= ======== ================ =========== ============ SQLServerReportingServices 2312 Services 0 42,232 K What the Heck?! 😮 How is this possible? We changed the reporting tool config file, yet netsh still shows that port 8082 is in use. Upon rechecking the reporting service logs, we confirmed that the application is indeed running on port 8083. 🤔\nIt turns out that the URL with port 8082 was reserved by SQL Reporting Services with an Access Control List (ACL) during installation. Changing the config file alone wasn’t enough. To see the list of URL reservations for HTTP services, use this command:\nnetsh http show urlacl Output:\nReserved URL : https://*:8082/ User: NT SERVICE\\SQLServerReportingServices Listen: Yes Delegate: No SDDL: D:(A;;GX;;;BU)(A;;GX;;;LS) To free up port 8082 for our front-end application, we needed to delete this obsolete HTTP reservation:\nnetsh http delete urlacl url=http://+:8082/ Output:\nDeleted Successfully. To confirm that the port is free and available for use, run:\nnetstat -noa | find \u0026#34;8082\u0026#34; The expected output should be blank! 😉\nFinally, the port is free!\n","permalink":"https://bookofdaniel.in/posts/port-not-available/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYes, you read that right.\u003c/strong\u003e The port you’re trying to use is already occupied by another application.

Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s, is a powerful tool designed to manage containerized applications in a scalable and automated fashion. This blog post aims to provide a high-level understanding of Kubernetes architecture using an analogy of ships, which simplifies the complex interplay between its components. Special thanks to KodeKloud for their insightful lecture, which inspired this overview.\nThe Kubernetes Cluster: Ships at Sea At its core, a Kubernetes cluster comprises two types of nodes: worker nodes and master nodes. To understand their roles, let\u0026rsquo;s imagine a fleet of ships:\nWorker Nodes (Cargo Ships): These ships carry the actual load—in Kubernetes, this translates to running your containerized applications. Master Nodes (Control Ships): These ships oversee and manage the cargo ships, ensuring everything runs smoothly. Master Nodes: The Control Ships Master nodes are the brain of the Kubernetes cluster, managing the state and operations of the entire system. They contain several key components, collectively known as the control plane:\netcd: A highly available key-value store that keeps all cluster data. Think of it as the central database that logs the details of every ship and container.\nKube Scheduler: Similar to cranes that load containers onto ships, the Kube Scheduler assigns containers to nodes based on resource requirements, node capacity, and various constraints like node affinity and tolerations.\nControllers: These are specialized offices on the control ships handling specific tasks:\nNode Controller: Manages the state of nodes, ensuring they are operational and adding new ones to the cluster as needed. Replication Controller: Ensures the desired number of container replicas are running at all times. Kube API Server: The central management component that orchestrates all operations within the cluster. It exposes the Kubernetes API, allowing users and controllers to interact with the cluster, monitor its state, and make necessary changes.\nWorker Nodes: The Cargo Ships Worker nodes are where your applications run, managed by two key components:\nKubelet: The captain of the ship, responsible for communicating with the Kube API Server, receiving instructions, and managing containers on the node. The Kubelet also sends status reports back to the master nodes.\nKube-proxy: Ensures smooth communication between containers across different nodes by maintaining network rules on each node. This is essential for services to interact seamlessly, like a web server on one node communicating with a database server on another.\nContainer Runtime All nodes, whether master or worker, require a container runtime engine to run containers. While Docker is a popular choice, Kubernetes also supports other runtimes like containerd and CRI-O. This runtime environment is crucial for deploying containerized applications and components.\nConclusion Kubernetes architecture, with its intricate components and interactions, ensures efficient and scalable management of containerized applications. By likening it to a fleet of ships with dedicated roles and responsibilities, we can better understand the complex but elegant orchestration that Kubernetes provides.\nIn upcoming posts, we will delve deeper into each component, exploring their configurations and roles in greater detail.

Resource-Friendly: Consumes minimal system resources. Basic Components Command Prompt: The environment where batch files are executed. Commands: Instructions executed sequentially in a batch file. Scripting Elements: Include loops, conditional statements, and variables. 2. Requirements Batch programming doesn\u0026rsquo;t require any additional software installations on Windows operating systems as it utilizes the built-in Command Prompt. However, to create and edit batch files efficiently, the following are recommended:\nWindows OS: Any modern version (Windows 7, 8, 10, or 11). Text Editor: Notepad (built-in), Notepad++, or any other preferred text editor, Recommended: Visual Studio Code. Configuring the Command Prompt While not strictly necessary, configuring the Command Prompt for better usability can enhance the batch scripting experience:\nAccessing Command Prompt: Press Win + R, type cmd, and press Enter. Alternatively, search for \u0026ldquo;Command Prompt\u0026rdquo; in the start menu. Customization (Optional): Right-click the title bar of the Command Prompt window. Choose \u0026lsquo;Properties\u0026rsquo; to adjust settings like font size, layout, and color scheme for better visibility. Creating Your First Batch File Open a Text Editor: Right-click on your desktop or in any folder, select \u0026ldquo;New\u0026rdquo; \u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Text Document.\u0026rdquo; Enter a Simple Command: For example, type echo Hello, world!. Save the File with a .bat Extension: Click \u0026lsquo;File\u0026rsquo; \u0026gt; \u0026lsquo;Save As\u0026rsquo;, name your file (e.g., HelloWorld.bat), and change the \u0026lsquo;Save as type\u0026rsquo; to \u0026lsquo;All Files\u0026rsquo;. Ensure the filename ends with .bat. Run Your Batch File: Double-click the file to execute or run it from the Command Prompt. Setting File Associations (Optional) If double-clicking the .bat file doesn\u0026rsquo;t execute it, ensure that .bat files are associated with the Command Prompt: Right-click on a .bat file and select \u0026lsquo;Open with\u0026rsquo; \u0026gt; \u0026lsquo;Choose another app.\u0026rsquo; Select \u0026lsquo;More apps\u0026rsquo;, scroll down, and choose \u0026lsquo;Look for another app on this PC.\u0026rsquo; Navigate to C:\\Windows\\System32 and select cmd.exe. Tips File Locations: Store your batch files in a dedicated folder for easy management. Testing: Always test new scripts in a controlled environment to prevent unintended actions. 3. Basic Commands Batch files execute a series of Command Prompt commands. Here, we\u0026rsquo;ll explore some fundamental commands that form the building blocks of batch scripting.\nCommand Purpose Example Description Echo Displays messages or turns command echoing on/off. echo Hello, world! Displays \u0026ldquo;Hello, world!\u0026rdquo; in Command Prompt. REM Adds comments in the script for readability. REM This is a comment Ignored during execution, used for notes. SET Creates or changes environment variables. SET name=John Sets the value of name to \u0026ldquo;John.\u0026rdquo; GOTO Directs the script to another section. GOTO END Jumps to the label :END in the script. Labels Marks a section of the script. :END Used with GOTO to create script sections. PAUSE Pauses the script, waiting for a key press. PAUSE Used for testing or script pauses. EXIT Exits the Command Prompt or a script. EXIT Closes the Command Prompt window in a script. Sample Batch File @ECHO OFF REM Sample batch script SET name=John echo Hello, %name%! PAUSE GOTO END :END echo Script is ending... EXIT This script introduces basic commands, including setting a variable, displaying messages, and controlling the script flow.\n4. Advanced Scripting Techniques After mastering basic commands, you can enhance your batch scripts with more sophisticated techniques. These advanced methods allow for greater flexibility and functionality in your scripts.\nUsing Variables Dynamic Variable Assignment:Variables can be set based on user input or other commands. Example: SET /P username=Enter your username: This command prompts the user to enter a username, which is stored in the username variable. Manipulating Strings: Batch scripts support basic string manipulation. Example: SET fullname=%firstname% %lastname% Concatenates two variables to create a full name. Conditional Statements IF Command: Used for making decisions in scripts. Syntax: IF [condition] [command] Example: IF %age% LEQ 18 echo You are a minor. Checks if the value of age is less than or equal to 18. Using ELSE: To specify an alternative action if the IF condition is false. Example: IF %number% EQU 10 (echo Number is 10) ELSE (echo Number is not 10) Loops FOR Command: Executes a command for each item in a set. Syntax: FOR %%parameter IN (set) DO command Example: FOR %%G IN (*.txt) DO echo %%G This will echo the name of each .txt file in the current directory. Subroutines CALL Command: Calls another batch file or a label within the same file. Example: CALL :subroutine Calls a label named :subroutine within the script. Creating a Subroutine: Example: :subroutine echo This is a subroutine. GOTO :EOF Error Handling ErrorLevel: Used to check the status of the last executed command. Example: IF %ERRORLEVEL% NEQ 0 echo Error occurred. Using EXIT /B: Exits the script or subroutine without closing the Command Prompt. Example: EXIT /B 1 Exits the subroutine or script and sets the ErrorLevel to 1. Delay Execution TIMEOUT Command: Pauses the script for a specified number of seconds. Example: TIMEOUT /T 10 Pauses the script for 10 seconds. Sample Advanced Batch File @ECHO OFF SET /P userinput=Enter a number: IF %userinput% EQU 10 ( echo The number is 10. ) ELSE ( echo The number is not 10. ) FOR %%G IN (*.docx) DO echo Found document: %%G CALL :subroutine EXIT :subroutine echo This is a subroutine. GOTO :EOF This script combines various advanced techniques, showcasing conditional logic, loops, subroutines, and user input.\nConclusion Advanced scripting techniques in batch programming significantly enhance the capabilities of your scripts, allowing you to automate more complex tasks and handle various scenarios efficiently.\n4. File Operations File operations are crucial in batch programming for managing files and directories. This section covers commands to perform various file operations such as creating, copying, moving, and deleting files and directories.\nCreating Files and Directories Creating a New File: Command: type nul \u0026gt; filename.ext Example: type nul \u0026gt; example.txt Creates an empty file named example.txt. Creating a Directory: Command: mkdir directoryname Example: mkdir MyFolder Creates a new directory named MyFolder. Copying Files and Directories Copying a File: Command: copy source destination Example: copy example.txt D:\\Backup\\example.txt Copies example.txt to the D:\\Backup directory. Copying a Directory: Command: xcopy source destination /E /H /C /I Example: xcopy MyFolder D:\\Backup\\MyFolder /E /H /C /I Recursively copies MyFolder to D:\\Backup, including hidden files and subdirectories. Moving and Renaming Files and Directories Moving a File: Command: move source destination Example: move example.txt D:\\Archive Moves example.txt to D:\\Archive. Renaming a File or Directory: Command: ren oldname newname Example: ren example.txt new_example.txt Renames example.txt to new_example.txt. Deleting Files and Directories Deleting a File: Command: del filename Example: del example.txt Deletes example.txt. Deleting a Directory: - Command: rmdir /S /Q directoryname - Example: rmdir /S /Q MyFolder Deletes MyFolder and all of its contents. Working with File Attributes Changing File Attributes: Command: attrib [+|-][R|A|S|H] filename Example: attrib +R example.txt Sets the read-only attribute to example.txt. Sample Script for File Operations @ECHO OFF mkdir MyDocuments type nul \u0026gt; MyDocuments\\doc1.txt xcopy MyDocuments D:\\Backup\\MyDocuments /E /H /C /I move MyDocuments\\doc1.txt MyDocuments\\document.txt del MyDocuments\\doc1.txt rmdir /S /Q MyDocuments This script demonstrates creating a directory and a file, copying the directory, renaming a file, deleting the file, and finally deleting the directory.\nConclusion Understanding file operations in batch programming is essential for effective script writing, especially when handling bulk file management tasks. These operations lay the foundation for automating routine file management tasks in a Windows environment.\n5.

In this post, we\u0026rsquo;ll explore a practical framework that addresses this common issue, allowing you to effortlessly surpass your goals. This system has been successfully used to develop the discipline needed to hold a 15-minute plank every day. Join me on this journey, and let\u0026rsquo;s unlock your raw power together.\nStep 1: Action-Oriented Goals Instead of setting vague and impractical goals, focus on specific actions within a defined time frame. For instance, rather than aiming to lose 20 pounds, set a goal to complete 10,000 push-ups by the end of the year. Break down the goal into actionable steps, visualize each step, and establish a non-negotiable daily minimum to make progress.\nExamples:\nGoal: Learn computer programming Action: Code 25 functional programs Goal: Get into a relationship Action: Have 100 interesting conversations with strangers Goal: Become a famous YouTuber Action: Make 100 videos packed with value Step 2: Minimize Friction Identify and eliminate real and imagined friction in your journey. If the gym is too far away, make the ground you stand on your gym. Remove unnecessary obstacles, such as the need for a personal trainer. Break down actions into 5-minute chunks, making them easily achievable and minimally taxing on your resources.\nExamples:\nGym too far away? Your ground is the gym. No personal trainer? Do 10 burpees without one. Intimidated by learning Spanish? Start with one word a day. Step 3: Anchor and Toll Anchor your new habits to existing routines in your daily life. Create a toll system where you attach a cost to certain activities, making them conditional on completing specific tasks. For example, learn one Spanish word before accessing the shower. Get creative with tolls to reinforce positive behaviors.\nExamples:\nAnchor: Listen to audiobooks while taking dumps. Toll: 10 push-ups before playing video games. Toll: Learn one Spanish word before taking a shower. Step 4: Pavlov\u0026rsquo;s Dog Conditioning Pair your daily actions with something incredibly enjoyable, creating a Pavlovian association. Follow the sacred rule: only engage in the enjoyable activity when performing the specified action. This conditions your brain to crave the task, making it enjoyable and effortless.\nExample:\nSacred rule: Play a phone game only while holding a plank. Step 5: The Feather Approach Gradually introduce small increments to your routine, making them feel almost negligible. If you started with a 20-second plank, increase to 25 seconds. This feather approach ensures a smooth transition, preventing burnout. Repeat this process until the combined weight of your actions becomes second nature.\nStep 6: Build the Skyscraper Continuously add new Lego bricks and feathers to your routine, creating a skyscraper of positive habits. With a solid anchor or toll, these habits will seamlessly integrate into your daily life. The compounding effect of these habits will lead to exponential growth and make you unstoppable in pursuing larger projects and goals.\nConclusion: By following this step-by-step framework, you can transform your life and become unstoppable in achieving your goals. The key is consistency, creativity, and a commitment to building a skyscraper of positive habits that elevate you to new heights. Start today, and watch as the compounding power of these habits propels you towards a limitless future.\nSource: https://youtu.be/fesslaSxdqs?si=40VEBURtZr6X9yJf\n","permalink":"https://bookofdaniel.in/posts/the-unstoppable-framework/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWe all aspire to be better, stronger, smarter, and healthier, yet many struggle to stick with their goals.

Enter Admiral William McRaven\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Make Your Bed,\u0026rdquo; a book that\u0026rsquo;s anything but your average fluff-and-fold self-help manual. Think less feng shui, more forging a battle cry in the crucible of Navy SEAL training. This ain\u0026rsquo;t about smoothing out your duvet; it\u0026rsquo;s about scaling metaphorical Mount Everest, one messy pillowcase at a time.\nMcRaven throws down ten life lessons that sting with truth and resonate with anyone who\u0026rsquo;s ever wrestled with life\u0026rsquo;s tangled sheets.\nLesson 1: Start small, conquer big. Making your bed is a tiny triumph, but it sends a ripple of accomplishment through your day. It whispers, \u0026ldquo;I can do this,\u0026rdquo; a mantra that empowers you to tackle seemingly insurmountable obstacles. You know, like that presentation that feels like climbing Everest in stilettos. One sheet at a time, you\u0026rsquo;ll conquer it.\nIf you want to change the world, start off by making your bed.\nLesson 2: Teamwork makes the dream (and boat) work. No SEAL goes solo. They rely on their squad, their cheerleaders with flippers, their \u0026ldquo;band of brothers\u0026rdquo; who navigate the choppy waters together. This translates to life as well. Find your tribe, those who\u0026rsquo;ll high-five your victories and hold your paddle when the current gets rough. Remember, even the mightiest battleship needs an anchor.\nIf you want to change the world, find someone to help you paddle.\nLesson 3: Size doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter, heart does. Forget judging people by their bank accounts or biceps. McRaven reminds us that true strength lies in character, resilience, and the size of your (figurative) heart. A kind word from the smallest person can change the world, so spread kindness like confetti. Remember, even the tiniest pebble can create the biggest ripples.\nIf you want to change the world, find someone to help you paddle. If you want to change the world, measure a person by the size of their heart, not the size of their flippers.\nLesson 4: Life is a sugar cookie crumble (and that\u0026rsquo;s okay). Sometimes, no matter how hard you bake, your life cookie crumbles. You bomb a presentation, trip in public, or stub your toe on the existential dread of the universe. It happens. The key is to dust yourself off, lick the icing sugar tears, and keep baking. Remember, even the most perfectly decorated cookies sometimes fall apart.\nIf you want to change the world, get over being a sugar cookie and keep moving.\nLesson 5: Embrace the circus (of failure). Life is a three-ring spectacle of awkward moments, missed opportunities, and flat tires. Don\u0026rsquo;t let fear of failure paralyze you. Embrace the stumbles, learn from the clowns, and remember, even the most graceful tightrope walkers wobble sometimes. So stumble gracefully, laugh at your mishaps, and remember, falling down is just another way of flying (sort of).\nIf you want to change the world, don’t be afraid of the Circuses.\nLesson 6: Sometimes, headfirst is best. Take risks, challenge the status quo, and don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to slide headfirst down the metaphorical rope of life. You might surprise yourself, break a record, and land with a grin on your face (and maybe a few scrapes). Remember, playing it safe won\u0026rsquo;t get you to the trapeze, so swing boldly, even if it means a few bumps on the way.\nIf you want to change the world, sometimes you have to slide down the obstacle headfirst.\nLesson 7: Sharks are inevitable (but you can swim with them). The world is full of metaphorical sharks: bullies, doubters, and negativity. You can\u0026rsquo;t avoid them, but you can learn to navigate their waters. Stand your ground, be your best self, and remember, sometimes the best way to disarm a shark is with a confident smile and a well-placed tuna sandwich. Just like dolphins, swim with the sharks, but don\u0026rsquo;t become one.\nIf you want to change the world, don’t back down from the sharks.\nLesson 8: Be your lighthouse in the storm. When darkness descends, don\u0026rsquo;t let it extinguish your inner light. Stay calm, draw on your inner strength, and remember, even the faintest glimmer can guide others through the roughest seas. Be the beacon in the storm, the lighthouse in the fog, the reminder that even when the waves crash, hope keeps us afloat.\nIf you want to change the world, you must be your very best in the darkest moment.\nLesson 9: Sing in the mud (it helps). Hope is a powerful weapon. When you\u0026rsquo;re neck-deep in life\u0026rsquo;s muck, find a reason to sing. Share your light, inspire others, and remember, even a muddy chorus can change the world. So hum a tune, even if it\u0026rsquo;s off-key, because sometimes the only way to rise above the mud is to sing through it.\nIf you want to change the world, start singing when you’re up to your neck in mud.\nLesson 10: Never ring the bell (unless it\u0026rsquo;s for tea). Life throws challenges, but quitting is not an option. Push through the discomfort, persevere through the pain, and remember, the bell is always there, but the satisfaction of overcoming your fears is far sweeter than any escape. So keep climbing, keep fighting, keep singing in the mud, because the view from the top of the mountain is worth\nIf you want to change the world, don’t ever, ever ring the bell.\n","permalink":"https://bookofdaniel.in/posts/make-your-bed-summary/","summary":"\u003cp\u003ePicture it: your bed, a chaotic landscape of tangled limbs and rogue pillows, mirroring the state of your life.

Platforms like Twitter, founded by Jack Dorsey and others, were initially open-source ecosystems where developers could contribute, leading to features like hashtags and trending topics. This era was characterized by decentralized protocols, like email, allowing for diverse applications and innovation.\nHowever, as platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Google grew, they started organizing this vast information, turning social media into centralized repositories. This shift was efficient but led to the accumulation of power in the hands of a few companies, creating \u0026lsquo;walled gardens\u0026rsquo; where user data became a commodity for advertising revenue.\n\u0026ldquo;The digital revolution is not about technology; it\u0026rsquo;s about people.\u0026rdquo; - Howard Rheingold\nThe Problem: Addiction and Control 🕹️ The primary business model of social media companies pivoted to advertising, fostering designs that promote addiction - the infinite scroll, tailored feeds, etc. This change led to a significant shift in how content is delivered and consumed, prioritizing user retention over quality content. Moreover, this centralization led to concerns about censorship and data privacy, as these platforms gained control over what content is visible and who gets to see it.\nEnter NOSTR: A Glimpse of Hope ✨ Amidst these challenges, NOSTR emerged as a potential game-changer. Endorsed by influential figures like Edward Snowden and Twitter\u0026rsquo;s founder Jack Dorsey, NOSTR aims to decentralize social media. By creating an open protocol, it allows for a distribution of control, returning power to the users.\nNOSTR functions similarly to the email protocol, where data is decentralized, and various apps can access and display this data in unique ways. This system enables users to choose how they consume content, bypassing the limitations and biases of a centralized platform\u0026rsquo;s algorithm.\nThe Revolutionary Potential of NOSTR 💪🏻 NOSTR\u0026rsquo;s decentralized nature promises several benefits:\nUser Control and Innovation: Users can choose or even build applications that suit their preferences, fostering innovation. Data Ownership: Users have control over their data, reducing dependency on any single platform. Diverse Perspectives: Decentralization allows for a more diverse range of voices and content, reducing the echo chamber effect prevalent in current social media. The Broader Impact 🔥 NOSTR isn\u0026rsquo;t just about social media; it\u0026rsquo;s about redefining digital communication and interaction. From messaging to business services, its underlying protocol could revolutionize various aspects of our digital lives.\nConclusion: A Call to Action and Participation The journey of NOSTR is not just about technology; it\u0026rsquo;s about community participation and democratizing the digital space. As an open-source project, it invites contributions from everyone, echoing the early days of the internet where innovation and freedom were paramount.\nThe YouTube video, while informative, is just the tip of the iceberg. For those intrigued by NOSTR and its potential, the invitation is open to explore, contribute, and be part of this exciting new phase in the evolution of social media and digital communication.\n","permalink":"https://bookofdaniel.in/posts/the-rise-of-nostr-and-the-renaissance-of-social-media/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe early days of the internet were marked by a sense of freedom and innovation.

If you\u0026rsquo;re like me, a busy professional always on the lookout for the best way to streamline your day, you know that most productivity systems seem to add more to our plates rather than taking off the load.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;ve refined a no-fuss, high-impact productivity system that cuts through the noise. It\u0026rsquo;s a straightforward approach that resonates with the daily grind of our lives. This system doesn\u0026rsquo;t require complex apps or the latest gadgets; it thrives on the bare essentials, making it perfect for the realist who needs to get things done now.\nStrategy 1: The Inverted Pyramid Method 🕒 Picture your day as an inverted pyramid. This is about prioritization. The most critical task sits at the wide top, where you pour a generous three hours of focused effort. As the pyramid tapers, so do the time allocations for less critical tasks, going down to two hours and then one.\nHow It Works: Identify the Most Important Task (MIT): Start with what would make the most significant impact on your day or your overall goal. Allocate Time: Dedicate a solid block of time to this MIT. No distractions, just deep work. Descend the Pyramid: Move on to the next priorities in decreasing time increments. The inverted pyramid is flexible. You can adjust the time allocations based on your workload and energy levels, but the principle remains: start with the most significant task and work your way down.\nStrategy 2: The Pareto Principle or the 80/20 Rule 📊 The Pareto Principle is the idea that 80% of effects come from 20% of causes. It\u0026rsquo;s about leveraging the most impactful actions to yield the greatest results.\nApplying the Principle: Evaluate Your To-Do List: Look at your tasks and ask which ones will have the most considerable impact. Focus on High-Leverage Activities: Direct your efforts toward these high-impact activities. Minimize Low-Impact Work: Avoid spending too much time on tasks that don\u0026rsquo;t contribute significantly to your goals. Remember, the Pareto Principle isn\u0026rsquo;t about doing less work; it\u0026rsquo;s about doing more of the right work. Strategy 3: Intelligent Breaks 🚶‍♂️ Work smart, not hard. That means taking breaks — but not just any breaks. Smart breaks can enhance productivity, while poor ones can detract from it.\nWhat to Do on a Break: High-Intensity Exercise: Even a few minutes can significantly boost BDNF, which is great for brain health and focus. Mindfulness Practices: Meditation or deep breathing can reset your mental state. Nature Walks: A stroll outside can rejuvenate your mind and body. The idea is to step away from your work in a way that refreshes you, not one that further fragments your attention. Strategy 4: Focused Work Blocks 🧘‍♀️ When it\u0026rsquo;s time to work, really work. This is about undivided attention and eliminating multitasking.\nTips for Focused Work: Create a Distraction-Free Environment: Silence your phone, close unnecessary tabs, and clear your workspace. Use Tools to Enhance Focus: Noise-cancelling headphones or apps that block distracting websites can help. Single-Task: Focus entirely on one task at a time to maximize efficiency and quality of work. In summary, the essence of this productivity system lies in its simplicity and flexibility. It\u0026rsquo;s about making the most of your time and effort by focusing on what truly matters. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re aiming for academic excellence, professional growth, or personal development, these strategies can be tailored to fit your needs and help you achieve your goals.\nUntil next time, keep it productive, folks! 🔥\n","permalink":"https://bookofdaniel.in/posts/the-ultimate-productive-system/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn the high-speed hustle of modern professional life, we often find ourselves chasing time, trying to grasp every fleeting minute.

If yes, our situation in operations might resonate with you. On any given day, our Zoho Desk is inundated with approximately 300 tickets, each falling under various classifications and priorities. Many of these tickets are complex and time-consuming to resolve, causing them to carry over to the next day and become overdue.\nThe challenge we face is the lack of visibility into critical metrics. Questions like the total number of tickets created, the various classifications in use, the resource who close the most tickets, and pending tickets are difficult to answer definitively. Convincing others about the work overload has proven to be quite a task.\nWhile Zoho Desk does offer predefined dashboards and customization options, our workflow relies heavily on custom fields. Additionally, the platform lacks real-time monitoring capabilities.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve followed along this far, you may find yourself in a similar scenario or be seeking solutions for building real-time monitoring functionality within Zoho Desk. Keep reading!\nChallenges As a team, we set out to tackle these challenges head-on, with the ultimate goal of maximizing throughput and efficiency to ensure customer satisfaction. Here are the key challenges we identified on our team board:\n1. Large Team Management: With a growing client base, our team size has expanded proportionally. Managing a larger team is becoming increasingly challenging without access to key metrics.\n2. Ticket Assignment Automation: Currently, our ticket assignment process involves agents or team members manually assigning tickets from a common email account. Some agents assign tickets to themselves, while others choose to assign them to the next team member. This variation in assignment might be due to differences in ticket complexity, with some opting for the low-hanging fruit.\n3. Timely Escalation: To maintain SLA compliance, we required a solution which will escalate the tickets to a manager when there is breach in a predefined time threshold (e.g., x minutes/hours).\n4. Email Tickets with Mandatory Fields: Zoho Desk offers a convenient feature that allows users to raise tickets via email. However, this feature creates tickets without mandatory fields, such as client or environment name. This calls for communicating the team over and over again resulting in time consumption.\n5. Real-Time Monitoring \u0026amp; Scoreboard: The absence of a real-time dashboard has caused inefficiencies in tracking productivity.\nImproving Daily work is even more important than doing daily work. - The Phoenix Project\nSolutions I have slept on these challenges for a day and explored the Zoho documentation along with some Google search. It seemed like I could solve some of these issues using zoho\u0026rsquo;s features, while others might require development.\nChallenge Solution Large Team Management Proposed to split the team into multiple pods or pools. So that it can be managed by a senior / lead with minimal members and work can be monitored efficiently. Pool segregation will be based on the number of clients. Ticket Assignment Automation Since the team is arranged into multiple pools, based on the client hierarchy, whenever a ticket is raised for the specific client it should be allocated directly to the respecitve pool. Then the pool lead / member can assign and work accordingly. To Automate this process Zoho Desk provides a feature called Direct Assignment. Create an assignment rule with client name and select respective pool account. Viola! The ticket will be assigned automatically on creation. Timely Escalation Zoho provides a feature called SLAs escalation. If an escalation occurs within x minutes it will be escalated to 2 levels. We chose to adopt it, so that the breached ticket will be esclated to the respective lead / manager of the pool within 30 mins. Email Ticket with mandatory fields We created a Zoho Task to close the email ticket with an automated reply to fill the mandatory fields. So the tickets in which the mandatory fields are not filled will be closed automatically. Real-Time Monitoring \u0026amp; Scoreboard Zoho analytics with additional license offers Dashboard experience but I needed something more interesting like a real-time dashboard to proactively act on tickets which does not require additional license.\nSo I came up with a solution which is powered by Grafana Dashboard and projected it on a monitor. For that, I used zoho web hook, instead of polling ticket meta details from Zoho desk.\nThe Webhook listener is developed using a simple java script. The json payload recieved will be deserialized and stored in a relational database like SQL Server.\nThen I created a Grafana Dashboard to pull the details from the database.\nArchitecture Diagram Final Results By incorporating real-time monitoring for Zoho tickets, my team\u0026rsquo;s productivity and efficiency increased tenfold. This enhancement not only bolstered accountability but also motivated everyone to aim higher and soar!\nA great team doesn’t mean that they had the smartest people. What made those teams great is that everyone trusted one another. It can be a powerful thing when that magic dynamic exists. - The Phoenix Project\n","permalink":"https://bookofdaniel.in/posts/integration-of-zoho-desk-and-grafana/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHave you ever been a part of a hardworking team that, despite their efforts, ends up shouldering blame?
