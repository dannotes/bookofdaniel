Redis is an open-source, in-memory key-value store known for its high performance and versatility. It operates primarily as a cache or a quick-response database, storing data in memory to enable low-latency read and write operations. Redis supports various data structures, including strings, lists, sets, and hashes, making it suitable for a wide range of applications from caching to real-time analytics. Its design allows for rapid data access and manipulation, which is crucial for applications requiring high throughput and low latency.

## High Availability Architecture (Sentinel)

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/0*VN8JCyjIRKtD7NFo.png)

To enhance reliability and availability, Redis can be paired with Redis Sentinel, a system designed to monitor Redis instances and manage failover processes. Sentinel provides automated monitoring of master and slave instances, ensuring that if the master fails, a slave can be promoted to master without manual intervention. This architecture allows applications to maintain continuous operation even in the face of server failures.Key features of Redis Sentinel include:

- Monitoring: Sentinel continuously checks the health of master and slave instances.

- Automatic Failover: In case of a master failure, Sentinel automatically promotes a slave to become the new master.

- Configuration Management: It updates clients with the new master information, allowing them to reconnect seamlessly.

Together, Redis and Sentinel create a robust architecture that ensures high availability and resilience, making it an ideal choice for applications that require constant uptime and reliable data access.

## How to Setup

To set up Redis with Sentinel on every machine for high availability, follow these detailed steps. This guide assumes you have three Linux servers ready, each running Redis and Sentinel.

## Step 1: Install Redis
On all three servers, install Redis using the following commands:  
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install redis-server
```
## Step 2: Configure Redis Instances
### Server Configuration Overview

- Server 1 (Master, 10.211.11.7) - Runs Redis as the master.
- Server 2 (Replica, 10.211.11.8) - Runs Redis as a replica of Server 1.
- Server 3 (Replica, 10.211.11.9) - Runs Redis as a replica of Server 1.

### On Server 1 (Master)
Edit the Redis configuration file located at `/etc/redis/redis.conf`:
  ```bash
  # Allow external connections
  bind 0.0.0.0
  
  # Set a password for replication
  requirepass your_master_password
  
  # Enable protected mode
  protected-mode no

  sed -i 's/^bind 127.0.0.1/bind 0.0.0.0/' /etc/redis/redis.conf
  sed -i 's/^protected-mode yes/protected-mode no/' /etc/redis/redis.conf
  sed -i "s/# requirepass foobared/requirepass <your_password>/" /etc/redis/redis.conf
  sed -i -E 's/^#?\s*masterauth.*/masterauth your_password_here/' /etc/redis/redis.conf
  
  # only in replica node
  sed -i -E 's/^#?\s*replicaof\s+<masterip>\s+<masterport>/replicaof new_server_ip 6379/' redis.conf
  ```

### On Server 2 (Replica)
Edit the Redis configuration file on Server 2:
  ```bash
  # Allow external connections
  bind 0.0.0.0
  
  # Set a password for replication
  requirepass your_master_password
  
  # Enable protected mode
  protected-mode no
  
  # Configure as a replica of Server 1
  replicaof <Server_1_IP> 6379
  
  # Set the master user for replication
  masterauth your_master_password

  sed -i -E 's/^#?\s*masterauth.*/masterauth your_password_here/' /etc/redis/redis.conf
  sed -i -E 's/^#?\s*replicaof\s+<masterip>\s+<masterport>/replicaof new_server_ip new_port/' redis.conf
  ```
### On Server 3 (Replica)
Repeat the same configuration as on Server 2, but point to Server 1's IP address.  
  
## Step 3: Configure Sentinel on Each Server
Create a Sentinel configuration file on each server. Hereâ€™s how to do it:  
  
### On All Servers (Sentinel Configuration)
Create a file named `sentinel.conf` at `/etc/redis/sentinel.conf`:  
  ```bash
  port 26379
  bind 0.0.0.0
  
  sentinel monitor mymaster <Server_1_IP> 6379 2
  sentinel down-after-milliseconds mymaster 5000
  sentinel failover-timeout mymaster 60000
  sentinel auth-pass mymaster your_master_password
  ```
    
Make sure to replace `<Server_1_IP>` with the actual IP address of your master server.  
  
Change permission of file to `redis` user
```bash
chown redis:redis /etc/redis/sentinel.conf
```
## Step 4: Start Redis and Sentinel Services
### Start Sentinel Instances
You can start the Sentinel service using the following command on each server:  
```bash
redis-server /etc/redis/sentinel.conf --sentinel
```
To run this command in the background, you may want to create a systemd service for Sentinel:  

Create a new service file at `/etc/systemd/system/redis-sentinel.service`:  
```ini
	[Unit]
	Description=Redis Sentinel
	After=network.target
	
	[Service]
	User=redis
	Group=redis
	Type=simple
	ExecStart=/usr/bin/redis-server /etc/redis/sentinel.conf --sentinel
	ExecStop=/usr/bin/redis-cli -p 26379 shutdown
	Restart=always
	
	[Install]
	WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
	  
Then enable and start the Sentinel service:  
```bash
	sudo systemctl daemon-reload
	sudo systemctl enable redis-sentinel.service
	sudo systemctl start redis-sentinel.service
```
### Start Redis Instances
On each server, start the Redis service:  
```bash
	sudo systemctl restart redis-server
	sudo systemctl enable redis-server
```
## Step 5: Verify Setup
To check if everything is working correctly, connect to one of the Sentinels:  
```bash
	redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL masters
```
This command should return information about the monitored master instance.

## Conclusion
With this setup, each server runs both a Redis instance and a Sentinel instance, providing high availability through monitoring and automatic failover capabilities. This configuration allows for redundancy and ensures that if one server goes down, others can take over seamlessly. Always ensure that your passwords are strong and consider additional security measures based on your environment's needs.
