        <description>üßëüèª‚Äçüíª Book Of Daniel http://localhost:1313/posts/integration-of-zoho-desk-and-grafana/ -&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been a part of a hardworking team that, despite their efforts, ends up shouldering blame? If yes, our situation in operations might resonate with you. On any given day, our Zoho Desk is inundated with approximately 300 tickets, each falling under various classifications and priorities. Many of these tickets are complex and time-consuming to resolve, causing them to carry over to the next day and become overdue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge we face is the lack of visibility into critical metrics. Questions like the total number of tickets created, the various classifications in use, the resource who close the most tickets, and pending tickets are difficult to answer definitively. Convincing others about the work overload has proven to be quite a task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Zoho Desk does offer predefined dashboards and customization options, our workflow relies heavily on custom fields. Additionally, the platform lacks real-time monitoring capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve followed along this far, you may find yourself in a similar scenario or be seeking solutions for building real-time monitoring functionality within Zoho Desk. Keep reading!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;challenges&#34;&gt;Challenges&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a team, we set out to tackle these challenges head-on, with the ultimate goal of maximizing throughput and efficiency to ensure customer satisfaction. Here are the key challenges we identified on our team board:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Large Team Management:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
With a growing client base, our team size has expanded proportionally. Managing a larger team is becoming increasingly challenging without access to key metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Ticket Assignment Automation:&lt;/strong&gt;
Currently, our ticket assignment process involves agents or team members manually assigning tickets from a common email account. Some agents assign tickets to themselves, while others choose to assign them to the next team member. This variation in assignment might be due to differences in ticket complexity, with some opting for the low-hanging fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Timely Escalation:&lt;/strong&gt;
To maintain SLA compliance, we required a solution which will escalate the tickets to a manager when there is breach in a predefined time threshold (e.g., x minutes/hours).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Email Tickets with Mandatory Fields:&lt;/strong&gt;
Zoho Desk offers a convenient feature that allows users to raise tickets via email. However, this feature creates tickets without mandatory fields, such as client or environment name. This calls for communicating the team over and over again resulting in time consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Real-Time Monitoring &amp;amp; Scoreboard:&lt;/strong&gt;
The absence of a real-time dashboard has caused inefficiencies in tracking productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improving Daily work is even more important than doing daily work.&lt;/strong&gt;  - The Phoenix Project&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;solutions&#34;&gt;Solutions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have slept on these challenges for a day and explored the Zoho documentation along with some Google search. It seemed like I could solve some of these issues using zoho&amp;rsquo;s features, while others might require development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Challenge&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Solution&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Large Team Management&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Proposed to split the team into multiple pods or pools. So that it can be managed by a senior / lead with minimal members and work can be monitored efficiently. &lt;br&gt; Pool segregation will be based on the number of clients.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Ticket Assignment Automation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Since the team is arranged into multiple pools, based on the client hierarchy, whenever a ticket is raised for the specific client it should be allocated directly to the respecitve pool. Then the pool lead / member can assign and work accordingly. &lt;br&gt; To Automate this process Zoho Desk provides a feature called &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/desk/automation/assignment-rules-notification/articles/creating-ticket-assignment-rules&#34;&gt;Direct Assignment&lt;/a&gt;. Create an assignment rule with client name and select respective pool account. Viola! The ticket will be assigned automatically on creation.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Timely Escalation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Zoho provides a feature called &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/desk/automation/escalate-sla/articles/creating-and-using-slas&#34;&gt;SLAs&lt;/a&gt; escalation. If an escalation occurs within x minutes it will be escalated to 2 levels. We chose to adopt it, so that the breached ticket will be esclated to the respective lead / manager of the pool within 30 mins.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;Email Ticket with mandatory fields&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;We created a &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/desk/activities/articles/working-with-tasks-zoho-desk#Creating_Tasks&#34;&gt;Zoho Task&lt;/a&gt; to close the email ticket with an automated reply to fill the mandatory fields. So the tickets in which the mandatory fields are not filled will be closed automatically.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;real-time-monitoring--scoreboard&#34;&gt;Real-Time Monitoring &amp;amp; Scoreboard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoho analytics with additional license offers Dashboard experience but I needed something more interesting like a real-time dashboard to proactively act on tickets which does not require additional license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I came up with a solution using Grafana dashboard and project it in a monitor. For that we used zoho web hook, instead of polling ticket meta details from Zoho desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Webhook listener is developed using a simple java script. The json payload recieved will be deserialized and stored in a relational database like SQL Server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we created a grafana dashboard to pull the details from the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A great team doesn‚Äôt mean that they had the smartest people. What made those teams great is that everyone trusted one another. It can be a powerful thing when that magic dynamic exists.&lt;/strong&gt; - The Phoenix Project&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Chapter I: The Grand Hall</title>

        <description>üßëüèª‚Äçüíª Book Of Daniel http://localhost:1313/posts/post-1/ -&lt;p&gt;Hello&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meta data updated&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three hundred and forty-eight years, six months, and nineteen days ago
to-day, the Parisians awoke to the sound of all the bells in the triple
circuit of the city, the university, and the town ringing a full peal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sixth of January, 1482, is not, however, a day of which history has
preserved the memory. There was nothing notable in the event which thus
set the bells and the bourgeois of Paris in a ferment from early morning.
It was neither an assault by the Picards nor the Burgundians, nor a hunt
led along in procession, nor a revolt of scholars in the town of Laas, nor
an entry of ‚Äúour much dread lord, monsieur the king,‚Äù nor even a pretty
hanging of male and female thieves by the courts of Paris. Neither was it
the arrival, so frequent in the fifteenth century, of some plumed and
bedizened embassy. It was barely two days since the last cavalcade of that
nature, that of the Flemish ambassadors charged with concluding the
marriage between the dauphin and Marguerite of Flanders, had made its
entry into Paris, to the great annoyance of M. le Cardinal de Bourbon,
who, for the sake of pleasing the king, had been obliged to assume an
amiable mien towards this whole rustic rabble of Flemish burgomasters, and
to regale them at his H√¥tel de Bourbon, with a very ‚Äúpretty morality,
allegorical satire, and farce,‚Äù while a driving rain drenched the
magnificent tapestries at his door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What put the ‚Äúwhole population of Paris in commotion,‚Äù as Jehan de Troyes
expresses it, on the sixth of January, was the double solemnity, united
from time immemorial, of the Epiphany and the Feast of Fools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that day, there was to be a bonfire on the Place de Gr√®ve, a maypole at
the Chapelle de Braque, and a mystery at the Palais de Justice. It had
been cried, to the sound of the trumpet, the preceding evening at all the
cross roads, by the provost‚Äôs men, clad in handsome, short, sleeveless
coats of violet camelot, with large white crosses upon their breasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the crowd of citizens, male and female, having closed their houses and
shops, thronged from every direction, at early morn, towards some one of
the three spots designated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each had made his choice; one, the bonfire; another, the maypole; another,
the mystery play. It must be stated, in honor of the good sense of the
loungers of Paris, that the greater part of this crowd directed their
steps towards the bonfire, which was quite in season, or towards the
mystery play, which was to be presented in the grand hall of the Palais de
Justice (the courts of law), which was well roofed and walled; and that
the curious left the poor, scantily flowered maypole to shiver all alone
beneath the sky of January, in the cemetery of the Chapel of Braque.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The populace thronged the avenues of the law courts in particular, because
they knew that the Flemish ambassadors, who had arrived two days
previously, intended to be present at the representation of the mystery,
and at the election of the Pope of the Fools, which was also to take place
in the grand hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was no easy matter on that day, to force one‚Äôs way into that grand
hall, although it was then reputed to be the largest covered enclosure in
the world (it is true that Sauval had not yet measured the grand hall of
the Ch√¢teau of Montargis). The palace place, encumbered with people,
offered to the curious gazers at the windows the aspect of a sea; into
which five or six streets, like so many mouths of rivers, discharged every
moment fresh floods of heads. The waves of this crowd, augmented
incessantly, dashed against the angles of the houses which projected here
and there, like so many promontories, into the irregular basin of the
place. In the centre of the lofty Gothic* fa√ßade of the palace, the grand
staircase, incessantly ascended and descended by a double current, which,
after parting on the intermediate landing-place, flowed in broad waves
along its lateral slopes,‚Äîthe grand staircase, I say, trickled
incessantly into the place, like a cascade into a lake. The cries, the
laughter, the trampling of those thousands of feet, produced a great noise
and a great clamor. From time to time, this noise and clamor redoubled;
the current which drove the crowd towards the grand staircase flowed
backwards, became troubled, formed whirlpools. This was produced by the
buffet of an archer, or the horse of one of the provost‚Äôs sergeants, which
kicked to restore order; an admirable tradition which the provostship has
bequeathed to the constablery, the constablery to the &lt;em&gt;mar√©chauss√©e&lt;/em&gt;,
the &lt;em&gt;mar√©chauss√©e&lt;/em&gt; to our &lt;em&gt;gendarmeri&lt;/em&gt; of Paris.&lt;/p&gt;
