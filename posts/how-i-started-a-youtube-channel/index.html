One common thread was that everyone was glued to their smartphones. YouTube trends during the pandemic showed skyrocketing watch times since everyone was either watching videos or sleeping.\nYouTube Shorts started gaining more traction over time, particularly those related to motivation. Everyone needed motivation because those were the tough times.\nSeizing the Moment ‚è±Ô∏è I was late to join the motivation genre. In June 2022, I realized the potential of starting a motivational channel. Compared to the other channels, like ‚ÄòDay in the Life‚Äô, educational, or travel channels, it‚Äôs relatively simple. You just cut clips from long-form videos of other channels into shorts of less than 30 or 60 seconds with copyright-free music.\nI started multiple motivational channels like learnwithniel and musetales. Some garnered a few views in the first month due to the infamous YouTube algorithm push. After that, the views dwindled.\nI‚Äôve long been a fan of Jay Shetty and a regular viewer of his Jay Shetty Podcast channel. In December 2022, I noticed there were no fan channels for Jay Shetty, so I started one called Jay Shetty Shorts üòâ.\nSince Jay Shetty is a popular motivational speaker, the channel was a hit. It attracted a lot of attention from both haters and supporters, which helped increase views and comments üòä.\nThe Grind of Consistency üí™üèª Before starting the YouTube channel, I thought it was easy money‚Äîpeople post videos and earn millions, like a money-printing machine.\nThen I realized that being a YouTuber is not easy! It‚Äôs a commitment to subscribers. If you‚Äôre consistent, the YouTube Algorithm will promote your videos, leading to more views. I committed to posting 2 clips + 2 shorts daily.\nIt was difficult because I was not naturally consistent. After starting this channel, I committed myself to editing videos daily. There were many sleepless nights, as I had to balance this with my day job. But let me tell you, it was worth it, and I experienced the power of consistency in my life.\n‚ÄúSuccess isn‚Äôt always about greatness. It‚Äôs about consistency. Consistent hard work leads to success. Greatness will come.‚Äù - Dwayne Johnson\nBeyond Subscribers and Likes üëçüèª On YouTube, having a large number of subscribers doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean higher earnings; it‚Äôs all about the views. If you have more views, you‚Äôll earn more and gain subscribers as a by-product.\nThe comments from Jay Shetty‚Äôs fans were one of my motivations for this channel. It was inspiring to see how supporters took the content to heart and how it inspired them to express love and inspire others.\nBut remember, if you‚Äôre solely focused on subscriber count, comments, and likes, you won‚Äôt be able to continue the journey of being a YouTuber. Do good work and commit to the cause.\nEarning for your hard work is also important since you‚Äôre investing a lot of effort and precious time.\n‚ÄúTime is what we want most, but what we use worst.‚Äù - William Penn\nMonetization and Google AdSense üí∞ YouTube isn‚Äôt the money printing machine I once thought it was. Your channel only starts earning after reaching certain thresholds: 1000 Subscribers (now 500), 4000 watch hours (now 3000), and for Shorts, 3 million valid public shorts views in 90 days. These thresholds are there to ensure you‚Äôre consistent and to see if it‚Äôs worth betting on you for Google AdSense revenue.\nBy the grace of God, I started earning within 1.5 months. The revenue isn‚Äôt the same for every channel; it depends on the content and the ads.\nOne Shorts video featuring Jay Shetty and Drew Barrymore helped me surpass the YouTube revenue threshold.\nSometimes all you need is a single shot to turn your hard work into a dream ‚ú®; keep digging ‚õèÔ∏è.\nThe Milestone: 100K Subscribers \u0026 The Silver Play Button üèÜ After six months of sleepless nights and consistent hard work, the channel reached 100K subscribers ‚ú®.\nDoes this number of subscribers mean something? Yes, in terms of hard work and consistency it‚Äôs a reward, but it doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre superior to anyone else; it humbles you to thank every subscriber, hater, and supporter for engaging with the content.\nIt took about three weeks to receive the YouTube Silver Play Button after reaching 100K subscribers.\nHolding that award for the first time felt good. I thanked Almighty God for it and, like a typical human being, shared the news on social media.\nMost of my colleagues and friends were surprised because only a few knew that I owned a YouTube channel.\nAfter posting on social media, I put the award back in its box and stored it away. I haven‚Äôt had the time to frame it and hang it on the wall.\nCopyright Strike ‚ö°Ô∏è By the time I had posted over 1000 videos and amassed 100K+ subscribers, I began receiving copyright strikes from SuperBam.\nI had anticipated this for a long time. üòä Although it was a fan channel, the content was still from the Jay Shetty Podcast Channel. The copyright strike was legitimate.\nThe nature of the strike was such that I could continue posting videos but was prohibited from earning any revenue from them.\nThe End Now, I have stopped posting videos as we are receiving copyright strikes ‚ö°Ô∏è. I‚Äôve learned so many things over these months and am thankful to Jay Shetty for pushing me to exceed my own limits regarding consistency. Editing his 1000+ videos has taught me about his commitment to his purpose and his consistency in posting weekly without fail.\nIf you are planning to start a YouTube channel, I hope this will serve as motivation for you. Consistency is the key in every trade.\n‚ÄúThe best time to start a YouTube channel was yesterday.‚Äù -
